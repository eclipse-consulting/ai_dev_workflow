### UAT Feedback for Editable Grid Component (Before Interactions)

1. **Table Structure**:
   - The table is correctly rendering with labeled rows and columns as per requirements (FR-01, FR-02, FR-03).
   - The row labels are clearly aligned and visually distinct from the column headers.

2. **Editable Cells**:
   - Cells are visually indicated as editable (contenteditable), but it would be beneficial to have clearer placeholder text (e.g., "Enter value") to inform users about the expected input (FR-04).

3. **Styling Consistency**:
   - The styling appears consistent with Tailwind CSS utilities; however, the blank editable cells could have a more defined style to enhance visibility (FR-10).

4. **Summary Row**:
   - The summary row is present and styled appropriately as per the specifications, using bold text (FR-05).

5. **Tooltip and Help Text**:
   - There are no visible tooltips or help indicators present for usability assistance; implementing this would improve user guidance (FR-12).

6. **Accessibility**:
   - The table appears to use basic semantic HTML elements which support accessibility; however, ARIA labels could further enhance screen reader support (FR-11).

7. **Overall Usability**:
   - The overall layout is user-friendly and should allow for effective data input. Verifying the functionality of editable cells during interactions will be crucial (NFR-01).

8. **Design on Different Devices**:
   - Ensure that responsive design classes are tested on various screen sizes to confirm usability across devices (NFR-01, FR-01).

### Recommendations:
- **Add Placeholder Text**: Include clearer placeholder text in editable cells.
- **Implement Tooltips**: Introduce tooltips and help text for user guidance.
- **Enhance Focus Management**: Ensure that elements receive visual focus styles when navigated via keyboard.
- **Test Responsiveness**: Verify that the table adapts well on devices of varying sizes. 

Overall, the UI setup meets many specified requirements, and further interactive testing is necessary to ensure functionality aligns with user expectations.
